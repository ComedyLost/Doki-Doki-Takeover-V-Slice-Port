# Current Plans

- Implement a custom dialogue system to handle cutscenes instead of using the V-Slice conversation system (would make cutscenes a lot easier to port)
- Make the menus fully functional
- Port the rest of the mod
  - This means that 0.7 is scrapped since 0.6 will now be the last update (unless there is more I could possibly add) (Pico Mixes / Erect Remixes?)
- Update the Discord RPC system to use the icon name instead of the character name (would allow songs like Our Harmony & Love n' Funkin' to show the correct icon)
- Try separating the rest of the vocals
  - Current vocal separations I'm currently working on
    - Constricted
    - Drinks on Me
    - Love n' Funkin'
- Finish the rest of the results music (might be scrapped since I don't know how to even start on those)
- Custom Pico Game Over Music(?) (Currently thinking about it)
